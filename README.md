# Smart Race Contract and UI

The goal is to create a smart contract for the creation and management of race events.  Ideally, races will be entered with an exchange token of some sort that can be used to post race times after the event conclusion.  The organizers will be able to set a participation fee to be taken from each participant with the ability to automatically redistribute some of the entrace fee to the winners or use the fees to cover any additional organizational costs.
