# Smart Race Contract and UI

The goal is to create a smart contract for the creation and management of race events.  Ideally, races will be entered with an exchange token of some sort that can be used to post race times after the event conclusion.  The organizers will be able to set a participation fee to be taken from each participant with the ability to automatically redistribute some of the entrace fee to the winners or use the fees to cover any additional organizational costs.  

## Feature Roadmap
- [ ] Cleanup hackday quality code
- [ ] Lock signups after event commences
- [ ] Allow race time submissions _only_ by the organizer
- [ ] Allow a user to query the contract for their position/time and the leaderboard
- [ ] Organizer can designate a fee to collect from each particpant
- [ ] Organizer can open a prize pool with a contributing fee taken from each particpant
- [ ] Automatic distribution of prize pool after results are totaled
